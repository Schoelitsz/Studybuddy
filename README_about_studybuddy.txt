This project is an unfinished prototype I worked on in a group at university. 
The assignment was to create a concept of an app to distribute questionnaires to students about their mental health
The goal was to find a way to make filling in those questionnaires attractive for students. For example with reward points.

My idea was to instead create an interactive experience where the student talks to the "study buddy" about how they feel, and the app
returns with tips, tricks or help resources. So it becomes a buddy that is helpful to the target audience, and gathers the necessary data
during these interations.

I've uploaded this project to my personal github per the 21st of October to be a part of my portfolio. Over the next few months I intend
to improve to the prototype. Time stamps will indicate relevant contributions to the prototype.
